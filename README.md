# Components Web App

## Introduction
This is an empty project using the API Component Bundle and CWAModules to create an empty website. Better description coming soon!

I've chosen to use NuxtJS (VueJS) and API Platform (built on Symfony) for many reasons. They are some of the most fun frameworks to use, built by brilliant developers and very well maintained. This combines them to show what is possible, and mostly just using the standard features without heavy customisation.

## Requirements
- Docker Compose
- CI uses GitLab to deploy to Kubernetes

## Installation
- run `./bin/env` to create `.env.local` secret files by copying `.env` distribution files. These will be used when developing locally.
- When running in production you will need to ensure you have set your CI environment variables.
