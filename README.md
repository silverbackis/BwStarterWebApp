# Components Web App

## Introduction
This is an empty project using the API Component Bundle and CWAModules to create an empty website. Better description coming soon!

I've chosen to use NuxtJS (VueJS) and API Platform (build on Symfony) for many reasons. They are some of the most fun frameworks to use, built by brilliant developers and very well maintained. This combines them to show what is possible, and mostly just using the standard features without heavy customisation.

## Requirements
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation
- `./env`
- use `./run` instead of `docker-compose` to inject environment variables and get prompts for running in dev or production
